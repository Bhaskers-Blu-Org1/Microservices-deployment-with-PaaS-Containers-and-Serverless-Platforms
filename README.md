# Containers vs PAAS vs Serverless

> This project is in progress. However, you can visit [README_old.md](README_old.md) for instructions from the original version.

Flightassist is a Node.js example application for demonstrating and
comparing various application deployment technologies in the IBM Bluemix
public cloud.

The intent for this project, when complete, is that it will be
deployable as a Cloud Foundry application, a containerized application
using at least one factored-out microservice, and as a set of
functions deployable to OpenWhisk, the IBM Bluemix function-as-a-service
offering.

Specifically, a set of trade-offs and comparisons can be made between
these deployment models, and this application is a proving ground for
those discussions. This will be the basis for the talk given by
Lin Sun and Phil Estes at [IBM Interconnect 2017](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/)
titled [Containerize, PaaS, or Go Serverless? A Case Study in
Application Deployment Models](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/4467A).

## Included Components
The scenarios are accomplished by using:

- [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org)
- [Kubernetes Clusters](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_ov.html#cs_ov)
- [OpenWhisk](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/openwhisk)
- [Cloudant NoSQL Database](https://cloudant.com)
- [Insights for Weather](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/Weather/weather_overview.html#about_weather)
- [TripIt Developer API](https://www.tripit.com/developer)
- [FlightStats Developer API](https://developer.flightstats.com)


## Prerequisites

- Install [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) and Setup [Kubernetes Cluster](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_tutorials.html#cs_tutorials) for PAAS and Containers deployments.

- Register and obtain the [TripIt Developer API](https://www.tripit.com/developer/create) and [FlightStats Developer API](https://developer.flightstats.com/signup) to query flight status. 

  When signing up for a FlightStats developer key, note that there is a
  review process that may take 24 hours or more to get your application
  credentials activated for a 30-day trial with the API.


- Futhermore, install [OpenWhisk CLI](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli) and Mark down its credentials for  deploying flightassist with serverless.

- Lastly, we will use Bluemix's [The Cloudant NoSQL database service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south) and [Insights for Weather service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/weather-company-data?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south) for our database and weather data. Therefore, run the following commands to create cloudant and Insights for Weather service. 

	> For this example, we recommend you name your services to *mycloudant* and *myweatherinsights*.

  ```bash
  bx service create cloudantNoSQLDB Lite mycloudant
  bx service create weatherinsights Free-v2 myweatherinsights
  ```

  Before moving on, the demo application is missing code to create the databases used
  to cache API responses in your newly created Cloudant instance. One simple way
  to make sure these databases are initialized is through the Bluemix console UI.
  Go to your new Cloudant service and open the Cloudant UI console using the link from your
  service instance page. Once at the Cloudant console you will need to
  create the **trips**, **weather**, and **connections** databases for
  the cacheing code to work properly.

  Alternately, you can run the following commands with your cloudant URL (You can go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps/ and found it in your mycloudant service credentials) to create the databases.

  ```bash
  curl -k -X PUT {your-cloudantURL}/trips
  curl -k -X PUT {your-cloudantURL}/weather
  curl -k -X PUT {your-cloudantURL}/connections
  ```

## Deploy using DevOps Toolchain (In progress)

Click the following button to deploy your app. Then go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps and select your application. Click the *Runtime* settings for your application and add these four environment variables to set up external credentials to the TripIt and FlightStats services:
   - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_ID` : application ID assigned by FlightStats
   - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_KEY` : application key assigned by FlightStats
   - `TRIPIT_API_KEY` : API key assigned by TripIt
   - `TRIPIT_API_SECRET` : API secret assigned by TripIt
   - `BASE_URL`: You URL for accessing your application. e.g. {app_name}.mybluemix.net

In addition, you can add the following environment variables to enable serverless.
- `OPENWHISK_AUTH` : Your OpenWhisk Authentication. You can run `wsk property get --auth | awk '{print $3}'` to view your authentication
- `USE_WEATHER_SERVERLESS` : put `true` to enable serverless option.
- `USE_WEATHER_SERVICE` : put `false` to disable the microservice for weather because it will intervene the serverless option.

  - 2. [Kubernetes Clusters](#2-kubernetes-clusters)
- [Scenario Three: Deploy Flightassist with Serverless using OpenWhisk](#scenario-three-deploy-flightassist-with-serverless-using-openwhisk)

After you deployed Flightassist using any platform, you can go to [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

# Scenario One: Deploy Flightassist on Cloud Platform using Cloud Foundry

In this scenario, we will deploy Flightassist as a monolithic application and host it on Cloud Foundry.

First, type the following commands to push your application with your own unique application name.

```bash
cf push {your_unique_app_name}
```

Now, go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps and select your application. Click the *Runtime* settings for your application and add these four environment variables to set up external credentials to the TripIt and FlightStats services:
   - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_ID` : application ID assigned by FlightStats
   - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_KEY` : application key assigned by FlightStats
   - `TRIPIT_API_KEY` : API key assigned by TripIt
   - `TRIPIT_API_SECRET` : API secret assigned by TripIt
   - `BASE_URL`: You URL for accessing your application. e.g. {app_name}.mybluemix.net

Your application should restart automatically, but can be done manually as well
in the UI. With the service bindings and added environment variables, the
application should be operational at the hostname route you selected for your CF
application. 

Congratulation, now you can learn about [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.


# Scenario Two: Deploy Flightassist as containers using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes Clusters

In this scenario, we want to break down Flightassist to multiple containers. Therefore, we will run Flightassist as our main application with weather-service as our microservice to query the weather data. Then, we will host those containers using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. 

## 1. Docker Swarm

First, rename the `dot-env` file to `.env` file. Add all the credentials for **FLIGHTSTATS_APP_ID**, **FLIGHTSTATS_APP_KEY**, **TRIPIT_API_KEY**,**TRIPIT_API_SECRET**,**CLOUDANT_URL**, and **WEATHER_URL** to your `.env` file.

Then, run the following commands to build your docker images and run Docker Swarm. 

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.local -t flightassist .
docker build -f flightassist-weather/Dockerfile.alpine -t weather-service flightassist-weather
make swarmdeploy
```

Now, your FlightAssist application should be running on http://localhost/


## 2. Kubernetes Clusters

First, install the container registry plugin for Bluemix CLI.

```bash
bx plugin install container-registry -r Bluemix
```
Next, build your own docker images and push them to your own bluemix container registry.

> Replace `<namespace>` with your own namespace, you can view your namespace by running `bx cr namespaces`
>
> If you have unauthorized error, run `bx cr login` to authorized your container-registry.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.local -t registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/flightassist .
docker build -f flightassist-weather/Dockerfile.alpine -t registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/weather-service flightassist-weather
docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/flightassist
docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/weather-service
```

Then, you need to run the following commands to bind your Cloudant and Weather Insights services to your clusters. 

```bash
bx cs cluster-service-bind {your-cluster-name} default mycloudant
bx cs cluster-service-bind {your-cluster-name} default myweatherinsights
```

Next, modify the secret.yaml file with **flightstats-app-id**, **flightstats-app-key**, **tripit-api-key**, and **tripit-api-secret**.

Then, edit the `flightassist.yaml` and replace the ```<namespace>``` with your own namespace. You can obtain your namespace by running `bx cr namespace`. Also replace `<your-app-end-point-url>` with your node ip and nodeport (e.g. 169.47.237.139:30080). You can obtain your IP by running `kubectl get nodes` and your nodeport is 30080.

Lastly, run the following commands to deploy the secret and deployment.

```bash
kubectl create -f secret.yaml
kubectl create -f flightassist.yaml
```

Congratulation, now your Flightassist application should be running on `http://<your_node_ip>:30080`. You can go to [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

# Scenario Three: Deploy Flightassist with Serverless using OpenWhisk

## 1. With Cloud Foundry

**Important**: You must complete [scenario one](#scenario-one-deploy-flightassist-on-cloud-platform-using-cloud-foundry) in order to proceed the following steps.

Go to the *Runtime* settings for your cloud foundry application and add these extra three environment variables to enable OpenWhisk:

- `OPENWHISK_AUTH` : Your OpenWhisk Authentication. You can run `wsk property get --auth | awk '{print $3}'` to view your authentication
- `USE_WEATHER_SERVERLESS` : put `true` to enable serverless option.
- `USE_WEATHER_SERVICE` : put `false` to disable the microservice for weather because it will intervene the serverless option.

Now save it and your application should restart automatically with serverless operating the weather functions. You can check your logs or go to [OpenWhisk Dashboard](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/dashboard) to varify the OpenWhisk action is being utilized to query the weather data for each airport.

Congratulation, now you can learn about [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

## 2. With Kubernetes Clusters

**Important**: You must complete [scenario two for Kubernetes Clusters](#2-kubernetes-clusters) in order to proceed the following steps.

First, you want to delete all the services and deployments from the previous scenario.

```bash
kubectl delete -f flightassist.yaml
```

Next, edit `flightassist_serverless.yaml` and replace the `<namespace>` with your own namespace, `<your-app-end-point-url>` with your node ip and nodeport, and `<your-openwhisk-auth>` with your OpenWhisk authendication. You can run `wsk property get --auth | awk '{print $3}'` to view your OpenWhisk authentication.

Now, let's deploy the new flightassist app with serverless.

```bash
kubectl create -f flightassist_serverless.yaml
```

Congratulation, now you can learn about [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

# How to Use Flightassist

First, you want to [add a trip on TripIt](https://www.tripit.com/trip/create). Then, add a new flight plan for your trip. In your plan, please fill in your confirmation number or airline with flight number.

![Tripit plan](images/plans.png)

Once you added a new plan and you have your Flightassist running, open your Flightassist and click **Authenticate with TripIt** to login to Flightassist.

Now you can see the most recent flight status and weather for all your flights within 24 hours.
